# Analog_clock
I created a simple analog clock using the turtle library in python.
Trying to be sort of fancy I used while loop drawing squares, beware
there are several print(time) I used to check the accuracy. I left them in case
anyone dares to look at this. It doesn't actually display time of day just from start.
GUIDE: (I guess?)
Orange - seconds
Red - minutes
White - hours

Yeah, just had a bit of time and I take this as training.
